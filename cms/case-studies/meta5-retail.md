  meta5 was asked to streamline data aggregation and report creation for a
  retailer's SKU inventory, while making sure both the data and the reports were
  timely, accurate and comprehensive. This included reducing the amount of time
  the retailer's data analysts were collecting data, which was consuming 80% of
  their time.

  meta5 creates multi-phased solutions that enable greater accuracy,
  transparency and visibility of reports across your organization. 
f_case-solution: >-
  To reduce time collecting data and ensuring reports reflected timely, accurate
  data, meta5 created a proprietary, all-inclusive data warehouse in SQLServer
  with ETL extraction routines running on a nightly basis. meta5 also built a
  Product Detail Report (PDR) that detailed the SKU data lifecycle for every SKU
  across hundreds of stores. To scale across the organization, meta5also built
  starter-set applications using CAPSULE Technology that served as a
  foundational template for future use cases.
