f_case-challenge: >-
  meta5 was engaged by a health services provider to restructure a weekly
  time-reporting and payroll system that had overwhelmed their finance
  department, resulting in constant inaccuracies and corrections. 
f_case-description: >-
  meta5 streamlines reporting capabilities for increased accuracy
  andproductivity within your business. 
f_case-solution: >-
  In a two-phased approach, meta5 first downloaded employee and scheduling
  information, then transformed, reformatted and entered the data into a SQL
  database. A meta5 scheduling CAPSULE® identified when new shifts started and
  ended, triggering 5000 customized daily text messages that reminded employees
  to log in and log out—and improved payroll accuracy by XX%. In phase 2, meta5
  data integration allowed Community Care to pre-calculate weekly payroll, then
  text each employee a report to review and proactively correct
  errors—delivering a significant increase in payroll accuracy and time savings
  for the finance team.
