f_case-challenge: >-
  meta5 was tasked with reducing weekly manual effort for an electric utility's
  credit and payment services, which had been spending significant time manually
  generating and processing customer payment notification emails.‍
f_case-description: >-
  meta5 automates recurring reports and notifications, significantly reducing
  manual execution and effort for your data analysts. 
f_case-solution: >-
  meta5 reduced effort by over 87.5% by implementing CAPSULETechnology to
  generate and execute automated email delivery notifications. Now, the utility
  generates 1,000 letters in minutes. With meta5, credit and payment services
  were also able to match unidentified payments with the appropriate customer
  accounts, improving customer matches by more than 20% and reducing automated
  search time by over 75% compared to the previous system.
